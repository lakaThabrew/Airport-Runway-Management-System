# Airport Runway Management System
### Based on the dining philosophers problem

- An international airport has a limited number of runways (e.g., five runways).
- Multiple airplanes are arriving and departing. Each plane needs access to the control tower's clearance and one of the available runways.
- Planes must wait for their turn, request clearance, and then attempt to access a runway to land or take off.
- Runway allocation must be handled carefully to avoid all planes waiting for runways and never landing, some planes never landing/taking off, or crashes (runway accessed by more than one plane simultaneously). 


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guide to help you get started writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
